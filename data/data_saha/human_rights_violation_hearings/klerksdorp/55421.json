We realise that although this incident happened in 1989, some years ago, it still is obviously quite a difficult and a painful experience for you.  I would like you to tell the story so that we can take note of it.\n It concerns your late son, Pule Caiphus Nthoroane, who died on the 19th of November 1989.  Now before we talk about the incident, perhaps you can just tell us a little bit about Pule, the deceased.  How old was he in 1989 when he died and what was he doing?  Was he employed, was he \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 L M NTHOROANE\nmarried, has he got children, a wife, or what was his position?  Would you like to tell us.",

Then because they had beaten him at Makwassie, they even cut one of the veins on the top of the head.  When he arrived at the hospital, he usually heard a sound in he head, and he slept at the hospital, Westvaal Hospital. He only stayed on the system the 17th, then he went back to the mine. He didn't work at the mine. Then he said he must work for night shift.  Then because of the head problem he went to Leeudoringstad.  That is where they tortured and killed him.  Many things I didn't hear then because I didn't know who did that.  The person who brought the messages is the person who is there, because he was staying at Leeudoringstad, he is the person who can explain.  What I said,  I only told them, is that they have just said they have saved my son.  Then I said if they have received my son in the cell, what happened that he should be killed.  He has died.  They did the post-mortem. No member of the family was there. They even took him out of Leeudoringstad, they even took him to the Avbob mortuary.\n The person who can give evidence is Herbert Nthoroane.  Still, we were waiting.  Then they came back to me, after a week.  Then they sent William Tshogo, that I should sign papers.  Then I said I couldn't sign papers because I didn't know what I am signing for.  Then he left.  They came back from Leeudoringstad again that I should sign a paper, because I am a witness.
